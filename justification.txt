Justifications for 100 points
	
	Visually appealling website using complementary colors.
	
	CSS3 Features Implemented
		Shadow around game board border
		Rounded corners of borders
		Tilted text for player bank labels
		Support for multiple browsers
	
	Randomization of beads and bead colors was difficult to implement because our tileset had to be recreated to retain visibility of the beads.

	Good UI Design
		Red/blue circles offer feedback to the user, clearly showing which objects are clickable and which aren't.
		Number of beads in each house is displayed as an integer to allow for clear readability in case bead color blends in to background or they overlap.
		Clear and accessible guide to rules of the game.

	Modular tileset allows for quick design of new board skins by only modifying 4 tiles.
